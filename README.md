# FiveM-PlayerLog-Bot

This is a discord bot that keeps a track of every player on your fivem server.... You might need to do a few tweeks to make it work.

1. Add a bot token and your discord id in bot.py
2. Add Channel ID where you want to get logs in cogs/auto.py
3. After running this bot run IP command to give it your ip
4. Your bot will be good to go

**THis resp is still under devlopment and some code you might thinkis crap may be used in future**
